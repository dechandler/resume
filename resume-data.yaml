### Commscope

employer: Commscope
location: Remote / Austin, TX
tenure:
    start: April 2019
    end: February 2024
title: Staff QA Engineer (for Automation)

#### short description

Automated the deployment of highly variable load test environments with consistently evolving requirements and backend technologies

#### main points

- Wrote automation to build, manage, and tear down ephemeral test environments in a Linux server lab, then migrated to building private AWS VPC networks with EC2 instances and other AWS hosted services. This reduced test deployment from two weeks to a matter of hours. This was accomplished primarily utilizing Ansible, Terraform, Python and Bash

- Took ownership of server lab maintenance, including documentation of resources, repairing deployment functionality, and working with IT to clean up a compromise, earning both recognition and a bonus

- Improved observability of software and backend systems by dynamically provisioning federated Prometheus instances and developing the corresponding Grafana dashboards and Logstash pipelines

- Adapted other teams’ automation to fit the specific needs of Performance QA, which enabled testing in an environment more closely mirroring production and its development

- Collaborated with developers to optimize environment parameters and supporting service configurations to accommodate various deployments of software products

- Load tested software products using a variety of client simulators and data generators to test for performance regressions, create performance reports, and calculate AWS cost summaries. These helped customers and internal teams right-size environments and understand the software’s total cost of ownership

- Led a development task force, addressing technical debt in tools used by front-line support staff and authoring new tools that were severely needed
