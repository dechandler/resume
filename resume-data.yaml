      Note: my title at Commscope was properly Staff QA Engineer, but that
      describes my work poorly and causes confusion. not sure if
      changing this is permissible

      I generate this document via a template that creates an ODT file and converts that to a PDF, so I'm not sure how exported as a DOCX will look in MS Office. In case the DOCX formatting makes no sense, the PDF can be found here: https://github.com/dechandler/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf

    dates: Apr 2019 - Feb 2024
    bulletpoints:
    - Automated deployment of highly variable load test environments under a constantly evolving set of requirements, starting in a Linux server lab, moving to AWS EC2 instances, and ending up on EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) with other AWS hosted services. This brought test deployment from two weeks when I started to a matter of hours. The bulk of this was done with Ansible, Terraform, Python and Bash
    - Took ownership of server lab maintenance, which included documentation of resources, repairing deployment functionality, and working with IT to clean up a compromise, which earned me recognition that came with a bonus
    - Collaborated with developers to optimize environment parameters and supporting service configurations to accommodate various deployments of software products
    - Load tested software products using a variety of client simulators and data generators to provide performance reports and cost summaries

    - Implemented secure and sustainable solutions in response to customer requests, often overcoming language and cultural barriers and following up on incomplete information
    - Led a development task force, where we addressed technical debt in the tools used by front-line support staff and created a handful of new tools that were sorely needed
    - Authored, improved, and maintained tools and automation used by support staff. This includes applications and scripts which interact with internal APIs, log into and perform work on customer servers, query and manipulate databases, web scrape, and parse server logs, command output and network appliance configurations
    - Screened and interviewed candidates applying for positions on my team and contributed to the training of new hires
