## Professional Experience

#### Commscope

Title: Staff QA Engineer (for Automation)  
Tenure: April 2019 – February 2024  
Location: Remote / Austin, TX  

Designed, automated, and deployed highly variable load test environments with consistently evolving requirements and backend technologies


- Automated deployment of ephemeral test environments in a server lab, before migrating to private AWS VPC networks with EC2 instances and other AWS hosted services. This reduced test deployment from two weeks to a matter of hours. This was accomplished primarily utilizing Ansible, Terraform, Python, and Bash, with some services deployed to a Kubernetes cluster

- Authored technical documentation for automation tooling, so it could be used by other teams and integrated into larger runbooks

- Took ownership of server lab maintenance: documented resources, restored deployment functionality, and partnered with IT to remediate a security incident.

- Improved observability of software and backend systems by dynamically provisioning federated Prometheus instances and developing corresponding Grafana dashboards and Logstash pipelines

- Adapted another team's Terraform automation for Kubernetes (AWS EKS) to fit the specific needs of Performance QA, which enabled testing in an environment more closely mirroring production and its development

- Collaborated with developers to optimize environment parameters and supporting service configurations to accommodate various deployments of Java software products

- Conducted product load testing to identify regressions and generate reports on performance and AWS costs. These informed scaling and total-cost-of-ownership calculations for both customers and internal teams

#### Rackspace

Title: Linux Administrator II  
Tenure: November 2012 – June 2018  
Location: Austin, TX / San Antonio, TX  

Supported Linux servers and cloud deployments for Enterprise customers, additionally developing tools and automation used extensively by peers


- Deployed, configured, maintained, and hardened Linux servers (RHEL and Ubuntu), along with common services (e.g., SSHD, Apache, MySQL, NFS, Vsftpd, and PHP-FPM)

- Performed triage, troubleshooting, and root cause analysis in response to major and minor incidents

- Implemented security best practices and sustainable solutions in response to customer requests, often overcoming language and cultural barriers and following up on incomplete information

- Led a development task force, addressing technical debt in tools used by front-line support staff and authoring new tools that were severely needed

- Developed security processes for Wordpress filesystem permissions and spearheaded their proliferation. Besides improving our customers' security posture, this addressed a major support issue where incremental permission changes were causing fragility and runaway complexity in customer environments

- Authored, improved, and maintained tools and automation used by support staff. This includes applications and scripts in Python and Javascript which interact with internal APIs, log into and perform work on customer servers, query and manipulate databases (SQL and NoSQL), web scrape, and parse server logs, command output, and network appliance configurations

- Screened and interviewed candidates applying for positions on my team and assisted in training new hires

#### Texas A&M Computing & Information Services

Title: Student Technician – Help Desk & Student Computing Center  
Tenure: July 2008 – May 2012  
Location: College Station, TX  

- Managed campus computer lab operations (desktop PCs and large network printers) and authored and updated documentation on lab systems and processes

- Assisted students and faculty with personal machines by cleaning malware infections, assessing and fixing boot problems, recovering data, swapping hardware, OS reinstalls, as well as student account management
